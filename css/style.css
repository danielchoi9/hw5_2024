Step 1

The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. **You can complete this step later in the process - it won‚Äôt affect the larger views.

Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following:
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom,
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.


Check your work. The corners probably aren‚Äôt curving quite as you expected. Use Inspect Element to fix this problem. You will need to utilize a second selector.
